# Weddings By Mark - Couples Gallery PRD

## Original Problem Statement
Build a self-hosted application for sharing photos and videos with wedding clients (couples). The app should be simpler than Nextcloud with these key requirements:

- **Admin**: Secure login with username/password
- **File Structure**: Create nested folders (e.g., `Wedding Images/Videos/Album/Favourites`)
- **Upload**: Web interface to upload images and videos, support for large files (up to 25GB) and bulk uploads (600+ images)
- **Sharing**: Generate unique, customizable share links per folder (e.g., `weddingsbymark.uk/ginamark301021`)
- **Permissions**: Read-only (view/download), Edit (no delete), and Full access levels
- **QR Codes**: Generate QR code for any share link

## User Environment
- **Hosting**: Self-hosted on TrueNAS server using Dockge
- **Domain**: `weddingsbymark.uk` with SSL via Nginx Proxy Manager
- **External Port**: 3029
- **Data Paths**:
  - App Data: `/mnt/apps/gallerydata`
  - Media Files: `/mnt/nextcloud/galleryuserfiles`

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js with Tailwind CSS and Shadcn/UI
- **Backend**: Python FastAPI
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Deployment**: Docker Compose
- **Reverse Proxy**: Nginx (for internal routing)
